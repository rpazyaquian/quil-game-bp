# basic-game-test

A minimal application that covers the very basics that any game needs.

The aim of this application is to:

1. Run a loop.
2. Track system time.
3. Render system time.
4. Render current input state.

- A game loops.
- A game responds to input.
- A game tracks time.
- A game renders its state.

Basically, it's a clock.
